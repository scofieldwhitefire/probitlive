                          our Users. The first type of information is
                          un-identified and non-identifiable information
                          pertaining to you, which may be made available or

                          which the Non-personal Information is collected.
                          Non-personal Information which is collected may
                          include your aggregated usage information and
                          technical information transmitted by your device,
                          including certain software and hardware information
                          about your device (e.g., the device you use, the type
                          of browser and operating system your device uses,
                          language preference, access time and the website’s
                          domain name from which you linked to the Services,
                          etc.), in order to enhance the functionality of the
                          Services. We may also collect information about your
                          activity on the Services (e.g., pages viewed, online
                          browsing, clicks, actions, timestamps, etc.). The
                          second type of information is individually
                          identifiable information, namely information that
                          identifies an individual or may with reasonable effort
                          identify an individual (“Personal Information“). Such
                          information may include: Account Information: When you
                          sign-up and register to the Services, you will be
                          asked to provide us certain details about yourself.

                          website, we may collect from you the following

                          hometown, nationality, birthdate, phone number, as

                          passport or other identification number, and any other
                          information you agreed to share with us. Voluntarily
                          Information: We may collect information which you
                          provide us voluntarily. For instance, when you respond
                          to communications from us, communicate with us via
                          email or share additional information about yourself
                          through your use of the Services. We may also collect
                          the feedback, suggestions, complaints and reports
                          which you send to us. Please note that we may also
                          collect complaints about you from other Users, which
                          may include your Personal Information. For the
                          avoidance of doubt, if we combine Personal Information
                          with Non-personal Information, the combined
                          information will be treated as Personal Information as

                          may use the following types of cookies: Session
                          Cookies which are stored only temporarily during a
                          browsing session in order to allow normal use of the

                          collect information about your use of the Services.
                          Google Analytics collects information such as how

                          The Google Advertising ID is an anonymous identifier,
                          provided by Google Play services. If your device has
                          an Advertising ID, we may collect and use it for
                          advertising and user analytics purposes. We may also
                          use Apple’s Advertising Identifier (IDFA), which is a
                          non-permanent device identifier provided by Apple, and
                          any information obtained through the use of the
                          Advertising Identifier, for the purpose of
                          advertising. By downloading the Application or using
                          the Services you explicitly agree that we may
                          associate your Advertising ID and your Advertising
                          Identifier with your applicable persistent device
                          identifier. This will facilitate our ability to
                          improve your personalized experience. Further, we may
                          use other persistent identifiers for non-advertising
                          purposes. If your device does not have Advertising ID
                          or Advertising Identifier respectively, we will use
                          other identifiers.
